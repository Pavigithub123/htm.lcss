            Wireless digital notice board display to gather the information on
            display of LED matrix. This project can be also used in institutions or organization etc. 
            but, sending notices day to day is a heavy process. 
            This project deals with advanced notice board. 
            In Our proposed system the user will enable to transmit notices wirelessly on a notice board using 
            Controller NodeMcu having Wi-Fi Module with smart phone and users get auto notification using cloud.
            Its operation is based on microcontroller NodeMcu.  </p>

                    order to avoid the accidents in the unmanned railway crossing. In a country like ours where there are many
                    unmanned railway crossings, Accidents are increasing day by day. The railway gate can be operated to prevent
                    the accidents at the level crossing in terms of speed of the train. Automatic Railway Gate control System is an
                    innovative circuit which automatically controls the operation of Railway Gates detecting the arrival and
                    departure of train at the Gate.
